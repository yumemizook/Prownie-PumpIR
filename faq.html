      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>What is this site?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a website for tracking and sharing scores of the game "Pump It
        Up", dedicated for home users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        But wait, don't we have piugame.com a.k.a the official site already?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, we do. However, piugame.com is a website for arcade users, and is
        not dedicated for home users (unless you happen to have a cabinet hooked
        up to the Andamiro network).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>How do I upload a score?</h2>
      <p>
        You can upload a score by going to the score page and clicking the
        "Upload Score" button.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What is Pumpbility? How do I get it?</h2>
      <p>Pumpbility is a measure of how good you are at Pump It Up.</p>
      <p>
        It is calculated based on your grade and the difficulty of the chart you
        played.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed Pumpbility data can be found at
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10yVx2mYzFwfyM-MWif_6E1gFRvV4oNGiJRero46Obf4/edit?gid=0#gid=0"
          target="_blank"
          style="color: rgb(61, 255, 245); text-decoration: none"
          >this spreadsheet</a
        >. We expanded the data for level 29 and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>You can also see your Pumpbility on your profile page.</p>
      <p>
        We are working on changing the calculator for this to more accurately
        match the Pumpbility to each score.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        I play on StepF1/F2/P1/PumpSanity, why does this page uses the Phoenix
        scoring system?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is intentional. Combo-based scoring is an outdated mess and the
        score can't really be calculated without detailed input data, thus
        requiring more user input.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have instead opted in for a capped scoring system at 1,000,000 points
        (1:1 Phoenix scoring system). This is to make it easier for users to
        understand and compare scores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just input the judgement data, and the site will automatically calculate
        the score for you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I'm seeing ridiculous scores on the leaderboards. Are these real?</h2>
      <p>Yes and no.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of the current score submission system, it is possible
        to submit scores that are not legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are working on a more accurate score submission system, but until
        then, please let us know by submitting a report on the score page.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, if you are caught submitting scores that are not legitimate,
        your account will be banned for a really, really long time. Don't do it!
      </p>
      <h6 style="color: red; font-style: italic">
        P.S. If you see someone getting a Perfect Game on 1948 D32 they are 100%
        cheating
      </h6>
      <br />
      <h2>I'm seeing a score that is not legitimate!</h2>
      <p>
        If you see a score that is not legitimate, please report it by going to
        the score page > Report Score.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we find that the score is not legitimate, we will remove it from the
        leaderboards and your scores will be removed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>My data is not being updated!</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the current webpage structure, you have to go into your profile
        page to update your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are seeing a score that is not being updated, it is because the
        score isn't verified yet.
      </p>
      <p>Please contact an admin to let us know and correct the score.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>A user has inappropriate details on their profile!</h2>
      <p>
        If you see a user with inappropriate details on their profile, please
        report them by going to their profile > Report User.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we find that the user is breaking the rules, we will reset any
        information that violates the rules.
      </p>
      <p>Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
      <p>
        If such user happens to be an admin, a demotion will be carried out
        immediately.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>A user is harassing me or other users!</h2>
      <p>
        If you see a user harassing other users, please report them by going to
        their profile > Report User.
      </p>
      <p>
        (WIP) Additionally, immedieately block such user from contacting you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we find that the user is breaking the rules, we will issue a
        restriction on their account.
      </p>
      <p>Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
      <p>
        If such user happens to be an admin, a demotion will be carried out
        immediately, along with additional restrictions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Someone had access to my account and messed up my data...</h2>
      <p>
        If you think someone had access to your account and messed up your data,
        please contact an admin to let us know. We will look through backups to
        see if we can recover your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important that you contact us as soon as possible, as we can only
        keep backups for a limited time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>My account's data has got randomly messed up!?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, this happens to us too sometimes. We are working on a more stable
        data uploading codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, if you see your data getting messed up, please contact us to
        let us know. We will look through the case and see if we can fix it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I want to deactivate my account, but not deleting it completely</h2>
      <p>
        As of now, there is only an option to delete your account. We are
        working on adding a deactivation option.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, please contact us and we will lock you out of your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to regain access to your account, please contact us again
        with the email and username you used to register.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I want to delete my account</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to delete your account, go to your profile > Settings >
        Delete Account. We will delete your account and all your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not be able to register a new account again after deleting your
        account for a really, really long time, so think twice before deleting
        your account!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get caught creating an account after deleting your account, it
        counts as multi-accounting and will be handled as such.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What happens if I get caught breaking the rules?</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on the severity of the offense, there are corresponding
        punishments.
      </p>
      <p>For minor offenses, you will be given a warning.</p>
      <p>
        For larger-scale offenses, you will be excluded from the leaderboards
        and your scores will be removed.
      </p>
      <p>For severe offenses, you will be banned from the site.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What happens when you get banned?</h3>
      <p>
        You will be locked out of the features of this website, such as score
        submission, profile editing, and more. Basically, the website becomes
        read-only.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can know that you got banned by trying to access the website, and
        seeing a message in red saying "You have been banned from the site."
      </p>
      <p>
        If you or someone tries to access the profile page, they will see that
        the user is banned.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to appeal your ban, please contact an admin to let us know.
        We will look through the case and see if we can lift the ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the meantime, <span style="color: red">DO NOT</span> create or
        use other accounts to bypass the ban. We will ban each and every account
        you create and use, even if you didn't create it yourself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I did nothing and still got banned??? What gives???</h2>
      <p>
        If you did nothing and still got banned, it probably is because you are
        a multi-accounting user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, if you are caught creating an account after deleting your
        account, it counts as multi-accounting and will be handled as such.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you aren't multi-accounting, it is possible that you are being
        targeted by a multi-accounting user.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this happens, please contact an admin to let us know. We will look
        through the case and immedeately ban the malicious user and lift the ban
        on your account.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I deleted my account, but I want to register again!</h2>
      <p>
        No, you cannot. You will not be able to register a new account again
        after deleting your account for a really, really long time. This is to
        prevent multi-accounting!
      </p>
      <p>
        After at least 1 year, you can contact us to see if you can register a
        new account again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        What's the deal with multi-accounting anyways? I see it all the time in
        other games...
      </h2>
      <p>
        You're not wrong that it is a common practice in other games, but it is
        still a serious issue that we are trying to prevent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multi-accounting happens when you create and use multiple accounts to
        gain an unfair advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we let users create multiple accounts, the leaderboards would be
        filled with unneccesary garbage and there would be no way to keep track
        of who is actually good. Not to mention the website would be clogged
        with unnecessary accounts.
      </p>
      <h6>
        Just imagine this: A user who takes up the entire top 50 players of the
        website, all made from multiple accounts. What will happen if we let
        this happen? And no, don't pull the "This is good incentive to get
        players to get better" card. It's not. I have heard of this and other
        justifications before, and it's straight up bullshit.
      </h6>
      <p>
        As of right now, there is little means to tell if a user is
        multi-accounting. We are working on a more accurate system, but until
        then, one person per account, one account per person. No exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, if you are caught creating an account after deleting your
        account, it counts as multi-accounting and will be handled as such.

      <p>
        And if you still, still don't get it, we are more than happy to ban each
        and every fine account of yours. Keep that in mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        So what? I don't care about the rules! I'm just gonna create as many
        accounts as I want!
      </h2>
      <p>
        We won't let you succeed. We will ban each and every account you create
        and use, even if you didn't create it yourself.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Quick tip: Evading bans by using multiple accounts is a very good reason
        for us to place a block on your IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you somehow manage to evade the IP block, we will place a block
        on the entire ISP you are using.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also place a block on your IP address if you are caught using a VPN to evade the IP block.
      </p>
      <p>And as a last resort, we will place a block on the entire country you are in. You should get it now right? Riiiiight?</p>
      <p>Don't let us use scorched earth tactics on you and the rest of the playerbase.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>What about the "Trust your fellow users" motto?</h2>
      <p>
        We do trust our users, but people are people sometimes, so we also have
        to enforce the rules to keep the website running smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see someone breaking the rules, please report them by going to
        their profile > Report User.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>And what about the "No Revenge" motto?</h2>
      <p>
        We do not condone revenge. If you or a user is being targeted for
        revenge, please contact an admin as soon as you see it happening. We
        will take a look and put an end to it as soon as we can.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are the one targeting someone, please stop. We will seriously ban
        you if you continue.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        What about the "No Hate Speech"/ "No Racism"/ "No Discrimination"/
        whatever else motto?
      </h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned before, we do not condone hate speech or racism or any
        other form of discrimination. Always report such users to an admin.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will delete offensive content from the user's profile and from the
        site, and issue a restriction on their account.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Where can I contact the admins?</h2>
      <p>
        Look under. Find the footer of the page. There, you can find the contact
        information of the admins (currently 1 person).
      </p>
      <p>We are working on adding more admins, so stay tuned!</p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        I have made reports, but the user is still not banned/restricted/etc!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sorry for the inconvenience, but since the moderation team is only 1
        person, it may take a while to review the reports. We handle reports on
        a first-come, first-serve basis.
      </p>
      <p>We are working on adding more admins, so stay tuned!</p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        I have made a mistake and want to change my username/profile details!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Go to your profile > Settings > Edit Profile. You can change your
        username and profile details there with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there is a 7-day cooldown on changing your username, you can
        change your profile details as much as you want and if you want to

        fix it for you.
