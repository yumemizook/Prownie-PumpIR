        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>By using this website, you agree to the following terms of service:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use this website. While this webpage doesn't require an age
            verification, we reserve the right to ban users under the age of 13.</p>
        <p>We also reserve the right to immedieately and without notice prohibit future use of this website to users
            under the age of 13. This is to protect the safety of our users.</p>
        <p>If you had registered an account before the age of 13 and the account got banned, if you are now over the age
            of 13, you can contact an admin to unban your account.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Account Management</h2>
        <p>One player can only have one account. If you are caught using multiple accounts (unless under special
            circumstances), your account will be banned.</p>
        <p>The same goes for the same account being used by multiple players. If you are caught using the same account
            by multiple players (either with huge score differences (a.k.a. buffing)), your account will also be banned.
        </p>
        <p>You can request an account deletion by going into Profile > Settings > Delete Account. This will delete your
            account and all your scores.</p>
        <p style="color: red;">You will not be able to register a new account again after deleting your account for a
            really, really long time, so think twice before deleting your account!</p>
        <p>If you get caught creating an account after deleting your account, it also counts as multi-accounting and
            will be handled as such.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Score Management</h2>
        <p>You must submit legitimate scores. Scores that are not legitimate will be handled accordingly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For lighter offenses, such as incorrect details, we will correct it and give you a notification. If this is not done within 24 hours, you can contact an admin to correct it. Do note that you will be temporarily restricted from uploading scores if multiple errornous scores are submitted.</li>
            <li>For more serious offenses, such as buffing / cheating or uploading scores of fake charts, your account will be banned for a really, really long time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Reporting</h2>
        <p>If you see erronous scores, you can report them by going into the score > Report Score. This will notify an admin to investigate the situation.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can go to the user's profile > Report User. This will notify an admin to investigate their profile for falsified scores.</p>
        <p>By using this feature, you agree to use it wisely and not abuse it.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly reporting scores of users that are not breaking the rules will result in your account being temporarily restricted or permanently banned.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Social Features (soon to be implemented)</h2>
        <p>We will soon be implementing social features, such as rivalries, friends, and more. These features will be implemented in a way that is fair and balanced for all users.</p>
        <p>By using these features, you agree to use them wisely and not abuse them.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly abusing these features will result in your account being temporarily restricted or permanently banned.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Abusing features include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repeatedly harassing other users or admins</li>
            <li>Vandalizing other users' message boards</li>
            <li>Spamming the public message boards</li>
            <li>Spamming the IR with fake scores</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>If you are caught breaking these rules, your account will be banned. Depending on the severity of the offense, the ban may be permanent. (A long time)</p>
        <p>To reinstate your account, you must contact an admin and explain your case. If you are found to be innocent or you have proved your efforts to change your behavior, your account will be reinstated.</p>
        <p style="color: red;">Note: If your offense history is too severe, any or all of your appeals will be ignored completely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you have any questions, please contact an admin.</p>
        <br>
