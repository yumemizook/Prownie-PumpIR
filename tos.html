        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Welcome! By accessing or using this website, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>
        <hr>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Age Requirement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use this website.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to ban or restrict access to users under 13, with or without notice, to protect our community.</li>
                <li>If you registered before turning 13 and were banned, you may contact an admin for reinstatement once you are over 13.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Account Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player is allowed <strong>one account only</strong>. Creating or using multiple accounts (except in special, admin-approved cases) is prohibited and may result in a ban.</li>
                <li>Sharing an account between multiple players is not allowed. Accounts found to be shared or used for "buffing" will be banned.</li>
                <li>You may request account deletion via <em>Profile &gt; Settings &gt; Delete Account</em>. This will remove your account and all associated scores.</li>
                <li style="color: red;">After deleting your account, you will not be able to register again for a very long time. Please consider carefully before deleting.</li>
                <li>Creating a new account after deletion is considered multi-accounting and will be treated as such.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Score Submission</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All submitted scores must be legitimate and accurate.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minor offenses</strong> (e.g., incorrect details): We may correct the score and notify you. Repeated errors may result in temporary restrictions on score submissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Serious offenses</strong> (e.g., cheating, buffing, submitting fake charts): Your account may be banned for a considerable period of time.
                </li>

        </section>

        <section>

            <ul>
                <li>If you notice an erroneous or suspicious score, use the <em>Report Score</em> feature or report the user via their profile.</li>
                <li>Reports should be made in good faith. Abusing the reporting system (e.g., false or spam reports) may result in temporary or permanent restrictions.</li>
            </ul>
